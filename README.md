## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

```js, I didn't expect to use as many forEach scenarios as I did this project, but hey whatever it takes to get me through my learning process!

  inputBox.forEach((box, i) => {
    ....
  })

```

### Continued development

I'm still learning to utilize BEM properly, it's nowhere near perfect, and I often forget how to.
Best thing for me is to chant my little reminder of B - Block, E - Elemet, M - Modifier.
The amount of times I remind myself is unreal, but I am confident sooner than later I will nail it down!

Obviously, CSS is still a big hurdle for me that's mostly due to I'm a sucker for gorgeous Design / UI ,and I want to learn everything about it.

As for JS, I'm actually surprised at myself. It definetly has been a learning process when it comes to it. It's crazy it finally feels like I am understanding. I'm sure it's not perfect, but hey look at my past work you'd be proud too.

### Useful resources

Here's a few links that really helped me get throgh this project!

- [Regex Email](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/form/email-validation.php) - This helped me for the email validation portion.
